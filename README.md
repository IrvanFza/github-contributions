# GitHub Contributions

This is a simple project that lets you to render your recent GitHub contributions as a graph that can be embedded in your README. To get started, simply paste this into your README and change `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` to be your username.

```md
![YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME's Contributions](https://github.pumbas.net/api/contributions/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME)
```

This can also be used in HTML images:

```html
<img src="https://github.pumbas.net/api/contributions/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" alt="YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME's Contributions"/>
```

It works through a simple API that generates an SVG which can be used as an image in markdown. It utilises the amazing chart library [recharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts) to generate the graph.

## Customisation

There is also support for a number of options which allow you to style the graph to your hearts content. Each option can be configured through the use of query parameters in the url.

> **Note**
> All colours are hexcodes without the starting '#'. E.g. `#4BB5FC` â†’ `4BB5FC`.

Query Parameter | Description             | Type    | Default Value
----------------|-------------------------|---------|-----------------
`colour`        | The colour of the line and text. A partially transparent version of this colour is used for the shaded area and grid | Hexcode | `#4BB5FC`
`bgColour`      | The background colour of the graph | Hexcode or `transparent` | `transparent`
`dotColour`     | The colour of the dots for each day's contributions | Hexcode | `#E5E5E5`
`days`          | The past number of days to include in your contributions graph | Positive number | `30`
`area`          | Whether to shade the area under the curve | `true` or `false` | `true`
`width`         | The width of the SVG in pixels  | Positive number | `1200`
`height`        | The height of the SVG in pixels | Positive number | `450`

An example using some of these looks like:

```md
![YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME's Contributions](https://github.pumbas.net/api/contributions/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME?colour=5BCDEC&bgColour=0D1117&dotColour=FFFFFF)
```
